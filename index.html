      <p>
        Hi, I’m P. A. Harikrishnan — a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Kottayam. I’m passionate about creating practical and user-friendly software solutions. With a solid foundation in programming languages like C, Java, and Python, along with experience in MySQL and MongoDB, I enjoy solving problems and bringing ideas to life through code.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Beyond technology, I’m someone who finds inspiration in music, books, travel, and swimming. These hobbies help me stay balanced, creative, and open to new perspectives in both life and work.

    <h2>DanaSetu</h2>
    <p>
      DanaSetu is a charity-based mobile application developed using the MERN stack.
      The app serves as a platform to connect donors and receivers in need, aiming to make
      the donation process more accessible, transparent, and impactful. It features user
      authentication, a clean and responsive interface, and a secure backend for managing user
      and donation data. Working on DanaSetu helped me strengthen my full-stack development skills
      and understand the importance of building solutions that solve real-world problems efficiently.

    <h2>CARA</h2>
    <p>
      CARA (Career Recommendation and Assistance) is a web-based career guidance application that helps
      users identify suitable IT career paths based on their skills, interests, and personality traits.
      The system uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset containing 36 user attributes to predict
      2–3 potential job roles for each individual. In addition to personalized recommendations, CARA provides
      career roadmaps, job search functionality, and a recruiter portal. I was responsible for building and
      integrating the ML model, which gave me hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model selection,
      and real-world application of AI in career planning.
